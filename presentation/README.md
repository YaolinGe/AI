# Presentation for SCT 2024

I will use Andrew's slides and cut off some of those slides that have too much math and make it more understable on the top-level.

# Prompt: 
```
Find where the anomaly exists for the second half of the dataset. The first half is normal, assume there is only one significant anomaly region. Show me the index for start and end of the anomaly region. Double think and check your logic to make sure the evidence is clear why you say that is the anomaly region.
